# NavajoPipes
A pipe flow solver for the EWB-UCLA Navajo Water Project

## Motivations
The Navajo Water Project designs a solar-powered water system for a home in the Navajo Nation. This repository includes code that solves pipe flow problems and gives us a glimpse into how our system will operate. It is also a pedagogical tool, as its inner machinations are easier to understand than softwares like EPANET.

## Features
This repository includes the pipe system code, unit conversions, pump curve functions for use in the solver, linear and quadratic interpolation functions, and example Jupyter notebooks. The number of notebooks, unit conversion options, and pump curves will increase in the future.
